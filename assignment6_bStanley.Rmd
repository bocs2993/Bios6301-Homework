### Question 1 ###

**15 points**

Consider the following very simple genetic model (*very* simple -- don't worry if you're not a geneticist!). A population consists of equal numbers of two sexes: male and female. At each generation men and women are paired at random, and each pair produces exactly two offspring, one male and one female. We are interested in the distribution of height from one generation to the next. Suppose that the height of both children is just the average of the height of their parents, how will the distribution of height change across generations?

Represent the heights of the current generation as a dataframe with two variables, m and f, for the two sexes. We can use `rnorm` to randomly generate the population at generation 1:

```{r}
pop <- data.frame(m = rnorm(100, 160, 20), f = rnorm(100, 160, 20), gen=1)
```

The following function takes the data frame `pop` and randomly permutes the ordering of the men. Men and women are then paired according to rows, and heights for the next generation are calculated by taking the mean of each row. The function returns a data frame with the same structure, giving the heights of the next generation.

```{r}
next_gen <- function(pop,gen) {
    temp <- pop[((gen-1)*100-99):((gen-1)*100),]
    temp$m <- sample(temp$m)
    temp$m <- rowMeans(temp[-3])
    temp$f <- temp$m
    temp$gen <- gen
    temp
}
```

Use the function `next_gen` to generate nine generations (you already have the first), then use the function `hist` to plot the distribution of male heights in each generation (this will require multiple calls to `hist`). The phenomenon you see is called regression to the mean.  Provide (at least) minimal decorations such as title and x-axis labels.

```{r, tidy=T}
hist(pop$m, main="Male Height in Generation 1")
for (i in 2:9){
  poptemp <- next_gen(pop,i)
  hist(poptemp$m, main=paste("Male Height in Generation",i), breaks=9, xlab=" ")
  cat('\n','\n')
  pop <- rbind(pop, poptemp)
}
```

### Question 2 ###

**10 points**

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Use the simulated results from question 1 to reproduce (as closely as possible) the following plot in ggplot2.

![generations plot](http://d.pr/i/Xh0d+)

```{r}
qplot(data=pop, x=m, y=f, facets = ~gen)
```

### Question 3 ###

**10 points**

We know that the *U(-1,1)* random variable has mean 0. Use a sample of size 100 to estimate the mean and give a 95% confidence interval. Does the confidence interval contain 0? Repeat the above a large number of times (say, 1000) and set the RNG seed to `1000`. What percentage of time does the confidence interval contain 0? Write your code so that it produces output similar to the following (to save space, only output the first ten trials):

```{r}
std <- 2/sqrt(12)
trials <- data.frame(SampleMean = rep(0,1000), LowerBound = rep(0,1000), 
                     UpperBound = rep(0,1000), ContainsMean = rep(0,1000))
for (i in 1:1000){
  dat <- runif(100, -1, 1)
  trials$SampleMean[i] <- mean(dat)
  confInt <- trials$SampleMean[i] + qnorm(c(0.025,0.975))*std/10
  trials$LowerBound[i] <- confInt[1]
  trials$UpperBound[i] <- confInt[2]
  if (trials$SampleMean[i] >= confInt[1] & trials$SampleMean[i] <= confInt[2]) {
    trials$ContainsMean[i] <- 1
  }
}

trials[1:10,]
```
The 95% confidence intervals contain the mean `r sum(trials$containsMean)*100/1000`% of the time.

### Question 4 ###

**15 points**

Programming with classes.  The following function will generate random patient information.

```{r}
makePatient <- function() {
  vowel <- grep("[aeiou]", letters)
  cons <- grep("[^aeiou]", letters)
  name <- paste(sample(LETTERS[cons], 1), sample(letters[vowel], 1), 
                sample(letters[cons], 1), sep='')
  gender <- factor(sample(0:1, 1), levels=0:1, labels=c('female','male'))
  dob <- as.Date(sample(7500, 1), origin="1970-01-01")
  n <- sample(6, 1)
  doa <- as.Date(sample(1500, n), origin="2010-01-01")
  pulse <- round(rnorm(n, 80, 10))
  temp <- round(rnorm(n, 98.4, 0.3), 2)
  fluid <- round(runif(n), 2)
  list(name, gender, dob, doa, pulse, temp, fluid)
}
```

1. Create an S3 class `medicalRecord` for objects that are a list with the named elements `name`, `gender`, `date_of_birth`, `date_of_admission`, `pulse`, `temperature`, `fluid_intake`. Note that an individual patient may have multiple measurements for some measurements.  Set the RNG seed to `8` and create a medical record by taking the output of `makePatient`.  Print the medical record, and print the class of the medical record. (5 points)

```{r}
medRec <- function(){
  patient <- makePatient()
  names(patient) <- c('name', 'gender', 'date_of_birth', 'date_of_admission', 'pulse', 
                      'temperature', 'fluid_intake')
  class(patient) <- 'medicalRecord'
  return(patient)
}

set.seed(8)
patient <- medRec()
patient
class(patient)
```

2. Write a `medicalRecord` method for the generic function `mean`, which returns averages for pulse, temperature and fluids. Also write a `medicalRecord` method for `print`, which employs some nice formatting, perhaps arranging measurements by date, and `plot`, that generates a composite plot of measurements over time.  Call each function for the medical record created in part 1. (5 points)

```{r, tidy=T}
mean.medicalRecord <- function(patient){
  pul <- mean(patient$pulse)
  tem <- mean(patient$temperature)
  flu <- mean(patient$fluid_intake)
  out <- list("Mean Pulse"=pul, "Mean Temperature"=tem, "Mean Fluid Intake"=flu)
  return(out)
}

print.medicalRecord <- function(patient) {
  cat(sprintf("Name: %s\nGender: %s\nDate of Birth: %s", 
              patient$name, patient$gender, patient$date_of_birth), "\n\n")
  for (i in 1:length(patient$date_of_admission)){
      cat(sprintf("Date of Admission: %s\nFluid Intake: %s\nTemperature: %s\nPulse: %s", 
              patient$date_of_admission[i], patient$fluid_intake[i], patient$temperature[i],
              patient$pulse[i]), "\n\n")
  }
}

# Since each measurement has such difference scales, I chose to plot them on separate plots 
## so the graphs could be the most informative.
plot.medicalRecord <- function(patient) {
  sorted <- sort(patient$date_of_admission)
  indices <- c()
  for (i in 1:length(sorted)){
    indices <- c(indices, which(patient$date_of_admission == sorted[i]))
  }
  temp <- c()
  puls <- c()
  flui <- c()
  for (i in indices){
    temp <- c(temp, patient$temperature[i])
    puls <- c(puls, patient$pulse[i])
    flui <- c(flui, patient$fluid_intake[i])
  }
  par(mfrow=c(1,3))
  plot(sorted,temp,type='b', xaxt='n',col='red',
       xlab="Date of Admission", ylab = "Temperature")
  axis(1, at=sorted,labels=sorted)
  plot(sorted,puls,type='b', xaxt='n',col="green",
       ylab = "Pulse", xlab= "Date of Admission")
  axis(1, at=sorted,labels=sorted)
  plot(sorted,flui,type='b', xaxt='n',col="blue",
       ylab = "Fluid Intake", xlab= "Date of Admission")
  axis(1, at=sorted,labels=sorted)
  mtext(paste('Measurements for Patient: ',patient$name), outer = TRUE)
}
methods(class='medicalRecord')
mean(patient)
print(patient)
plot(patient)
```

3. Create a further class for a cohort (group) of patients, and write methods for `mean` and `print` which, when applied to a cohort, apply mean or print to each patient contained in the cohort. Hint: think of this as a "container" for patients.  Reset the RNG seed to 8 and create a cohort of ten patients, then show the output for `mean` and `print`. (5 points)

```{r}
# Function of how many people you want in cohort
# Assumes there is at least 2 patients in the cohort
cohortmaker <- function(number){
  cohort <- list(medRec())
  for (i in 2:number){
    tempPatient <- medRec()
    cohort[[i]] <- tempPatient
  }
  class(cohort) <- "cohort"
  return(cohort)
}

set.seed(8)
cohort <- cohortmaker(10)

mean.cohort <- function(cohort){
  for (i in 1:length(cohort)){
    cat('--> ', cohort[[i]]$name, '\n')
    print(mean(cohort[[i]]))
  }
}

mean(cohort)

print.cohort <- function(cohort){
  for (i in 1:length(cohort)){
    print(cohort[[i]])
    cat('-----------','\n')
  }
}

print(cohort)
```
